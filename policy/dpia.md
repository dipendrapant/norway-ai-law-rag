This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is developed and used solely for teaching purposes and complies with the EU AI Act, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Norwegian Personal Data Act. It processes only minimal, non-personal data and ensures that no personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) is stored or processed. User queries are not stored in raw form, and only anonymized logs may be retained for educational performance review. A one-page Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) screening is included under `docs/dpia.md`, confirming the system’s low risk due to its minimal data use and strong privacy safeguards. A Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is maintained with the cloud service provider (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces under an organizational account) and stored in `docs/dpa/`. The `sources.json` file should be updated whenever relevant laws or regulations change, followed by re-running `index.py` to ensure compliance continuity. If an external large language model (LLM) API is ever integrated, the provider must be added to the records of processing to reflect a proper controller–processor relationship, and the “no PHI” policy must remain strictly enforced.
